## Projects
[Stock Market Price Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/eloweDS/stock_market_project/tree/main)
- Created a model that predicts daily stock price movement which would help investors make more informed decisions based on whether the stock price will go up or down the next day.
- Scraped stock data from leading companies in the NASDAQ-100 index using yfinance API (imported into Python).
- Engineered a binary feature indicating daily stock price movement (0 for price decrease, 1 for increase). This was made the target variable. 
- Optimized and compared **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, and XGBoosting** classification methods. Each model was evaluated on how well they could forecast next-day price movement (up or down). Model performance metrics used include: **Accuracy, precision, error rate, recall, and F1-measure**.

[Comparative Analysis of Regression Models](https://github.com/eloweDS/regression_models_comparison)
- Evaluated the performance of six regression models across 20 diverse datasets, focusing on model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretation of model metrics.
- Regression models selected were: **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Principal Component Regression (PCR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Regression Splines**. Each model was applied to 20 datasets of different sizes, # of features, etc.
- Model performance metrics used: **MSE, RMSE, RSS, R^2, and RSE**. The performance of each regression model was compared using these metrics.
- The goal for this project was to gain a better understanding of how to build regression models, model selection, and how to interpret model metrics.

[Detroit Traffic Crashes EDA](https://github.com/eloweDS/traffic_crashes)
- Analyzed the traffic crashes data provided by the city of detroit on their open data portal.
- Utilized data analytical techniques such as EDA and segmentation to discover traffic crash insights in the city of Detroit. Results include most dangerous intersections /  primary roads, most/least dangerous weekdays, anomolies in speed limit, speed limit at which most accidents occur, etc.
- Charts and graphs were created to visualize trends and correlations in traffic crashes.
- Formulated a conclusion to explain findings.

[Electric Car Sales](https://github.com/eloweDS/EV_Sales_Shares/tree/main)
- Analyzed historic and projected electric car sales / share data. EV data provided by iea.org.
- Deliverables included:
  - Exploratory data analysis with 14 visualizations highlighting correlations, frequencies,        and regional EV trends.
  - Interactive Plotly Dash dashboard showcasing all visuals.
  - Deployment of the dashboard on Google Cloud.
  - Predictive modeling using Random Forest and XGBoost to forecast EV adoption trends.
