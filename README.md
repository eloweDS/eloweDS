### Projects
[Stock Market Price Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/eloweDS/stock_market_project/tree/main)
- Created a model that predicts daily stock price movement which would help investors make more informed decisions based on whether the stock price will go up or down the next day.
- Scraped stock data from leading companies in the NASDAQ-100 index using yfinance API (imported into Python).
- Engineered a binary feature indicating daily stock price movement (0 for price decrease, 1 for increase). This was made the target variable. 
- Optimized and compared ==Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, and XGBoosting== classification methods. Each model was evaluated on how well they could forecast next-day price movement (up or down). Model performance metrics used include: ==Accuracy, precision, error rate, recall, and F1-measure==.
